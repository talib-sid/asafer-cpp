Done:
- able to detect variable delcrations
    - their name, type, loc, etc 
    additionally, these are also possible (https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1VarDecl.html)
    - custom types also work 
    - tested with template classes too (multi-type as well) (multi-class as well)
    - when custom custom, template is DEFINED, not created, this VarDecl is still triggered but the differentiator is 
    that the varibale name in that case is empty, (SO AST does have a node even for the all custom definitons not only declarations)
    - at decl level, the templates are given just the name, and a &
    - at defn and deduction level, things are totally clear.

- detect new keyword
    - for vanilla 1D Array Alloc (test2.cpp) [dim_size ranged from 5 to 50000000000LL]
        - we get  Found variable: pchar 
            Type: char *
        - 2 unknown allocs (unsigned long long and void *)
        - always followed with enum of type std::align_val_t
    - 

- able to ignore comments




Work in Progress:



To be done:
- class imports, will render all the elements, the AST analysed is post all-linking that's why.
